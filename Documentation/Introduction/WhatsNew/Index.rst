What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

The main changes include new config.stat\_\* options which allow
anonymized storage of log information. For page.includeCSS and
page.includeJS\* conditions are now available.

The new stdWrap properties "cache" and "orderedStdWrap" were added.
stdWrap has been added to the HMENU options "maxItems", "minItems" and
"begin". The option config.htmlTag\_stdWrap, which makes more
modifications of the html tag possible, has been appended.

New properties of filelink.icon were appended. The option
config.pageTitleSeparator has been added allowing further
customizations of the website title. The meta object now offers the
new subproperty "httpEquivalent", which makes handling of meta tags
more flexible.

Additionally various descriptions were improved and many smaller
mistakes were fixed.

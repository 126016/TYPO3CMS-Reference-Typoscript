Appendix B â€“ Standard Templates
-------------------------------

**Note:** Until TYPO3 6.0 the system extension "statictemplates" had
to be installed to be able to activate this functionality. Since TYPO3
6.1 the extension statictemplates no longer is part of the TYPO3 Core.
Instead it needs to be installed from TER.


.. _appendix-static-template:

static\_template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section of the TypoScript reference is used to introduce the
standard templates that came with TYPO3 until version 6.0 in the
static table "static\_template".

From TYPO3 4.5 until TYPO3 6.0 the static templates were in the system
extension "statictemplates". *Normally* old records in the database
table static\_template are *not* changed from version to version!
However, *sometimes* changes may appear!


.. _appendix-media:

Media
^^^^^

The standard templates use some standard media-files, like gif images
and fonts. These are situated in the extension folder in typo3conf/
(in older versions in "typo3/sysext/statictemplates/media/", in
"typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/media/" or just in "media/") relative to the
root of the TYPO3-website.

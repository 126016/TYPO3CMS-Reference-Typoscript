Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The values you assign to properties in TypoScript are often of a
specific format. The following table describes these formats.

E.g. if a value is defined as the type "<tag>", you're supposed to
supply HTML code. If it is of the type "resource", it's a reference to
a file from the resource-field in the template. If the type is
"GraphicColor", a color-definition is expected and you should supply
an HTML color code or comma-separated RGB-values.
